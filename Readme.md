# TypoGen Translator (C++ Version)

This project is a C++ implementation of the **TypoGen** translator, designed to process and render typography-based designs for print-on-demand products such as T-shirts, mugs, posters, and more. The TypoGen language allows users to define typography elements and export them as image mockups. This started life as a ChatGPT prompt to create a programming language for Print On Demand (POD) products. More specifically, doing the inital creation of typography.

## Features

- **Lexer**: Tokenizes the TypoGen input script into a sequence of tokens.
- **Parser**: Parses the tokens into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and interprets the design instructions.
- **Renderer**: Generates a PNG image using the **Cairo** and **FreeType** libraries for rendering text and custom fonts.

## Example TypoGen Script

Below is an example of a TypoGen script (`example.typogen`):

```typo
canvas "T-shirt" {
    width: 500px;
    height: 700px;
    color: "white";
}

typography "Code is Life" {
    font-family: "Arial";
    font-size: 42pt;
    font-color: "black";
    alignment: center;
    effect: shadow(2px, 2px, "gray");
}

preview on "T-shirt";
export as "mockup_tshirt.png";
```

## Dependencies

To compile and run the TypoGen Translator, you will need the following dependencies:

### Required Libraries:

1. **Cairo** - A 2D graphics library used for drawing text, images, and shapes.
2. **FreeType** - A font rendering library used to load custom fonts (e.g., `.ttf` font files).
3. **GCC/Clang** - A C++ compiler.

### Install Dependencies (Ubuntu/Debian):

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libcairo2-dev libfreetype6-dev g++ make
```

For other Linux distributions or Mac, use the equivalent package manager commands (e.g., `brew` on Mac).

### Install Dependencies (Windows):

For Windows, you can use **MSYS2** or a similar toolchain to install Cairo and FreeType:

- [Install MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/)
- Install required packages:

```bash
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-cairo mingw-w64-x86_64-freetype
```

## Compilation Instructions

Once you have installed the necessary dependencies, you can compile the TypoGen translator by running the following command from the project directory:

```bash
g++ -o typogen main.cpp lexer.cpp parser.cpp render.cpp `pkg-config --cflags --libs cairo freetype2`
```

This will create an executable named `typogen`.

## Running the Translator

To run the TypoGen Translator, pass a TypoGen script as an input:

```bash
./typogen example.typogen
```

This will generate a PNG image (e.g., `mockup_tshirt.png`) based on the design instructions in the TypoGen file.

## Example Output

Given the example TypoGen script above, the output will be an image file (`mockup_tshirt.png`) showing the phrase "Code is Life" rendered in Arial font, centered on a white canvas that mimics a T-shirt mockup.

## File Descriptions

- **`lexer.hpp` / `lexer.cpp`**: The Lexer processes the TypoGen input script and tokenizes it into meaningful elements such as `canvas`, `typography`, and attributes like `width`, `font-family`, etc.

- **`parser.hpp` / `parser.cpp`**: The Parser takes the tokens generated by the Lexer and interprets them to build a design model for the typography and canvas.

- **`render.hpp` / `render.cpp`**: The Renderer generates the actual PNG image using the **Cairo** and **FreeType** libraries, rendering the typography with the specified properties (e.g., font, size, color).

- **`main.cpp`**: The main entry point that ties together the Lexer, Parser, and Renderer to process TypoGen scripts and produce mockups.

## Extending the Project

- **Support for Additional Effects**: You can extend the renderer to support additional text effects like gradients, rotation, or custom shadows.
- **Expand TypoGen Syntax**: Add support for more canvas properties or introduce new design elements such as shapes or images.
